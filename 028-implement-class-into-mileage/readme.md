# Week 13 
- You might have made a typo with the first instructuion professor. I think you meant we are supposed to copy code from 026-higher-order-functions rather than 027

# Challenge- Where to write the class
- We can write the class in our calculations.js file and specifically inside the trackMPGandCost function because that is where we have our object

# Where to implement our trip class
- We are going to implement our class wherever we have used miles, gallons, and price, because they are contained in our class. 

# What broke and how we can fix it
-Average MPG and Average Trip cost are displaying NaN. We can fix this by adding a function inside our class that will return average MPG and Trip cost
-Edit button does not work - We need to make sure that we can access the index of MY_TRIP_COST data. Is new object being pushed into the array, so we are able to read its index?
