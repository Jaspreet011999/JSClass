- the values ( miles,gallons and price) the user inputed into the program, so we can calculate the values to produce the miles per gallon.
- update the values in miles per gallon to display what the user's MPG will be depending on the value they insterted for miles, gallons and price and restart the program to take in new values, so we can go through the same process to read update and delete again.
