# Week 11
# What I thibk about the code 
- The code is no more organized, because I now have modules that serve a specific purpose, for example I know where the function for storing data is, the functions for performing all calculations, the function for rendering table, rows, buttons etc. Now the code is more readable and more maintenable.
# What should be done
- May be we could have modules the same way I have organized them here: (main-form validation, event listener), calculations, storage, and render. It would be more organized this way.
