# My thoughts
-AI is the future,since it is very helpful. It provides information really quickly, and when you get the queries/prompts right, it provides really useful information. I think it is going to replace certain people's jobs. I strongly believe that going into the future, it is either one will be working for an AI company, or be using and AI to do your job, or your job will be done by an AI. AI should complement our abilities, and tech people need to develop new skills that complement the abilities of AI. The future lies in data science and model training, and making AI perfect than it is right now. That is the future.
