# Week 10 Decision Making CRUD App
- When buying groceries, I normally check whether I have enough money. I then check what groceries I am missing or the groceries I need. The next thing I will check for is an affordable grocery store. When I get to the store, I will check the quality of the groceries, and this includes things like: Are they fresh? When is the expiry date? After I have confirmed these, I will buy the grocerries.  

- I will use nested if statements for my logic

# Week 13
- Our decision is based on our input. So upon filling all values, and clicking submit, our decision is generatd based on the input. So I will update DOM with the generated decision. 
- I don't think edit/delete would apply in the my scenario. 

# Week 14 
- I'm still working on the Edit/Delete function in my app. I'm trying to figure out where I should put it. I removed the expiry date. I figured out I won't need it because I have isFresh.
